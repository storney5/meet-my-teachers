   <h2>Course Teacher</h2>
   <p>Dr. Syrenthia Robinson</p>
   <h3>Course Description</h3>
   <p>The objective of this course is to introduce basic tools of multimedia production. In this class, I’ve been able to learn how to use Adobe Creative Cloud software applications like Audition, Premiere Pro and Illustrator. I’ve been able to create a radio commercial and my own sound effect in Audition, a B-roll video of Torg Bridge and a how-to video in Premiere Pro and recreate the VT logos and come up with my own in Illustrator. In lectures, we’ve learned about the early stages of digital media and how each medium got to the stage that it is now in 2018. We’ve also learned about different techniques that come with digital media technology.</p>

   <h3>What Do I Think of This Course?</h3>
   <p>I like this course. I took it as one of my major electives and I’m very happy I did. The experience I’m getting with different Adobe Creative Cloud applications is really helpful for me since I envision myself using these programs in my career. I’ve enjoyed all the projects we’ve had to do, and the class lectures are interesting. We’ve also had the chance to go into the studio in Moss Arts Center and learn about and practice the different roles that go into producing a news show. </p>
