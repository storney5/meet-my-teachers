   <h2>Course Teacher</h2>
   <p>Prof. Dale Jenkins<p>
   <h3>Course Description</h3>
   <p>Media Writing is all about the fundamentals of writing in a media setting. In this course, we’ve learned how to write in AP style, as well as learn how to write the different stories you see in media. These include press releases, event stories and feature stories. In this course, I’ve had the chance to interview different people to gather information for each of my stories. </p>

   <h3>Teacher's Biography</h3>
   <p>Prof. Jenkins earned his degree in journalism and psychology from the University of North Carolina. He also has a Master of Arts degree from Virginia Tech. Prof. Jenkins has professional experience in the field from when he worked as a reporter, photographer and copy editor for The Taylorsville Times in Taylorsville, North Carolina. His teaching interests are communication, public speaking, magazine writing and multicultural communication. However, Prof. Jenkins’ expertise is journalism, southern and Appalachian literature and biblical studies. Prof. Jenkins has been a phenomenal teacher to me this semester. He has greatly improved my writing and I now feel more confident in my ability. I would highly recommend taking Media Writing with Prof. Jenkins.</p>
   <h3>What Do I Think of This Course?</h3>
   <p>I think this has been a challenging but rewarding course this semester. My grades have significantly improved throughout the year due to my writing skill getting better. Prof. Jenkins is a tough grader, so you have to be pay very close attention to every detail and aspect of your writing in order to get a decent grade on papers. We also have AP style quizzes where we play the role of copy editor and make the right edits to sentences. Those have also helped me improve my writing. Overall, I think Media Writing has been a very helpful course for me this semester. </p>
