   <h2>Course Teacher</h2>
   <p>Dr. Jenn Mackay</p>
   <h3>Course Description</h3>
   <p>In Media and Society, we study the development of media and the effects it has on the rest of society. We’ve covered topics like censored books, the Beatles, video games, public relations campaigns and social media. A fully lecture based class, Media and Society’s only graded materials are two midterm exams, the final exam and class attendance.</p>
   <h3>Teacher's Biography</h3>
   <img src="Dr.Mackay.jpg" class="responsive"/>
   <p>Dr. Mackay earned her doctorate in mass communications from the University of Alabama. Prior to that degree, she earned her master’s in journalism from the University of Alabama and her bachelor’s in journalism and mass communications from the University of North Carolina. Her work has been featured in many books, book chapter, journals and textbooks. Dr. Mackay won the Outstanding Master’s Student Award from the University of Alabama and the Best Student Paper award from Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication in Toronto, Canada. Dr. Mackay is very knowledgeable on this subject and does a great job of explaining concepts to us.</p>
   <h3>What Do I Think of This Course?</h3>
   <p>Media and Society is not my favorite course this semester. It consists only of lectures with no real assignments or projects to do. The material is somewhat interesting, but it is tough to sit through for an hour and 15 minutes. However, Dr. Mackay does a good job of trying to keep our interest and attention during class. I think it is important to learn the concepts taught in this class, but I do have a hard time paying attention some times.</p>
