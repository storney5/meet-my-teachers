   <h3>Course Description</h3>

   <h3>Teacher's Biography</h3>
   <img src="Dr.Ivory.jpg" class="responsive"/>
   <p>Dr. Ivory earned her doctorate in philosophy and human development from Virginia Tech. Prior to that, she earned her master’s in communication from Virginia Tech and her bachelor’s in arts, psychology and sociology from the University of North Carolina. She’s written many book chapters and been involved in several research papers. Dr. Ivory’s expertise is health communication, media effects, media portrayals, and entertainment media content and effects. I’ve enjoyed being a student of Dr. Ivory’s. She is very qualified to teach a research course since she has conducted a lot of research.</p>
   <h3>What Do I Think of This Course?</h3>
   <p>Like Media and Society, Introduction to Communication Research is a dull course. The material is important to know, but it just isn’t very interesting. However, we have had a semester long group project that has been a cool experience. Through this project, our group gathered sources for a n annotated bibliography, prepared and conducted a focus group and is now preparing a survey to be sent out to students. Despite the lecture material not being anything special, I have enjoyed the group project. Much like Dr. Mackay, Dr. Ivory does a good job of holding our attention during class and getting us prepared to meet our group project deadlines. </p>
